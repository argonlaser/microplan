## Inspiration

> -- Sam Newman ( Building Microservices, chapter: "Evolutionary Architect" )

We wanted to solve a little bit of of the "Planning" side of the equation. We wanted a tool, that comes very handy. It should be very handy, like the terminal we open. wait ! why not, inside a terminal ?


## How to use ?
`microplan` can be used by developers/architects to plan work needed in multiple microservices, to implement one feature.

When you want to implement a new featurem you start by creating a feature file for it.
```bash
$ microplan init feature-name

# creates a file named feature-name
```
